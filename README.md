# SFND-Lidar-Project

This is the final submission for the SFND Lidar project.
The main source has been cloned from the udacity relative repository (https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection.git) and later the requested functions have been implemented locally.
I decided to create an own repository because in a first place it was made private.

In order to compile it Eigen3 and pcl libraries are required.

Commands for compiling:

rm -r build/  
mkdir build  
cd build/
cmake ..  
make  

Testing:  

./environment
